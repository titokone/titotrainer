=== Installation instructions ===

1. Make sure you have a recent JDK version 6 or later installed.
You also need a fairly recent Apache Ant installation to build the source.
PostgreSQL 8.2 or later is the only supported (=tested) database
engine at the moment.

2. Install Tomcat 6 and make sure you have access to the online application manager.

3. Extract the TitoTrainer2 source code to where you want
to store the application. We will set up Tomcat to use the application
from an external directory.

4. Copy build.properties.example to build.properties and edit the new
build.properties to have the correct path to your Tomcat installation.
The other parameters needn't be touched.

5. We assume you have PostgreSQL 8.2 or later set up.
The application requires a database and needs to access the database
as the the database owner via a network socket.
It is recommended the database be created with the UTF-8 encoding.

Example commands for creating a database and database user:
createuser -P someusername
createdb -O someusername -E UTF-8 somedbname

6. Copy WEB-INF/conf/default/db.properties to WEB-INF/conf/db.properties,
open the new copy and write your database connection URL, username and
password there.

7. Build the application by running ant build build-tools
in the source directory.

8. Initialize the database by running
ant Database.CreateSchema in the source directory.
If this fails, there is probably something wrong with your database setup
or connection parameters.

9. Create an administrator user account.

Option 1:
The following creates a user "admin" with the password "admin".
INSERT INTO "user" (id, parentrole, username, passwordsha1)
VALUES (nextval('hibernate_sequence'), '@ADMINISTRATOR', 'admin', '58aeda41c84041e38a15bffad6684d033bef6684');

Option 2:
Running ant Database.InsertTestdata creates
a user "admin" with the password "admin" and also adds some example data into
the database.

10. Navigate to Tomcat's conf directory.
Inside it, create the subdirectory Catalina and inside that, localhost.
Inside localhost create the file titotrainer2.xml with contents like the
following:
<Context path="/titotrainer2"
reloadable="true"
docBase="/path/to/titotrainer2-directory"
workDir="/path/to/titotrainer2-directory/work" />

11. Restart Tomcat, go to Tomcat's application manager and
start the application. The application should now be available at the path
you configured in the previous step.
Check Tomcat's log files if you have problems.

== Notes ==
* Tomcat Security Manager
  We did not have enough time to properly document the Java security
  permissions required by our application.
  Please disable Tomcat's security manager if it causes problems.

* It is a known bug that non-ASCII characters might not work properly on servers
  with a locale other than UTF-8.
